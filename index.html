          <h2>Let's connect with nature</h2>
            <p> Nature gifts many benefits to humans. From the air we breathe,
             the water we drink, and the food we eat, nature enhances our 
             wellbeing and freely provides the essentials for our survival.<br><br>
            For decades, scientists and environmentalists have discussed the 
            concept of ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s 
            that it became more common place. From 2001-2005, the Millennium Ecosystem
             Assessment (MA) embarked on a study to determine the impact on 
             humans should ecosystems continue to change.
             Drawing on the knowledge of over 1,000 experts from across the globe,
              they evaluated “the condition and trends in the world’s ecosystems 
              and the services they provide,” according to the MA website. 
              They also identified evidence-based science to determine the best
               methods for conservation, enhancement, and sustainable use of
                ecosystems.<br><br>
            While the concept of ecosystem services is commonly understood 
            within the science and environmentalist community, one study found 
            that it’s not necessarily common knowledge amongst the public. 
            That’s why we’ve put together some basic explanations and examples 
            below.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Ecosystem services are often broken down into four
                 broad categories.</h3>
                 <br>
                 <br>
             <h4> Supporting Services</h4>
             <br>
             <p>
             Supporting services are the foundation of ecosystems. 
             These natural processes keep them functioning and healthy.
              Supporting services include photosynthesis, the creation of soil,
               nutrient cycling, and pollination, among many others. 
            They basically make it possible for all life to exist and thrive.  
             </p>
             <br>
             <br>
            <h5>Provisioning Services</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Provisioning services are basically anything that can be 
            extracted from nature. The first thing people tend to think of
             is food. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, livestock, fish, and seafood
              are all direct products of ecosystems, according to the
               National Wildlife Federation (NWF). Beyond food, provisioning 
               services include drinking water, plants that can be 
               transformed into clothing and medicine, raw materials like
                timber and minerals, and other materials that can be 
                converted into energy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h6>Regulating Services</h6>
             <br><p>Regulating services moderate natural occurrences in ecosystems.
             They also ensure ecosystems continue to function in sustainable and
              resilient ways. For example, plants clean and filter water and also 
              help regulate air quality. Bees pollinate flowers, bacteria help
               decompose waste, while ladybugs help control pest populations 
               (think aphids). Tree roots even prevent erosion as they hold soil 
               in place.
